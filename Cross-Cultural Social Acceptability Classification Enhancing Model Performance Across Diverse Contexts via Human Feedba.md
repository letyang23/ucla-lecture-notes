# Cross-Cultural Social Acceptability Classification: Enhancing Model Performance Across Diverse Contexts via Human Feedback

## Abstract

Social acceptability classification is essential for identifying actions that may cause harm or discomfort within specific cultural contexts. Existing models often reflect narrow cultural perspectives, leading to misclassifications in diverse settings. This study aims to create a flexible social acceptability classification model that adapts to different cultural norms through human feedback and advanced techniques. We explore baseline models, introduce cultural guidelines, and implement simulated reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to enhance adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating cultural context significantly improves model accuracy from 42% to 68%. Implementing simulated RLHF further refines performance, achieving an accuracy of 72%. We discuss the methodologies, analyze the results both quantitatively and qualitatively, and address limitations and future work.

## 1. Introduction

In an increasingly globalized world, artificial intelligence models interact with users from diverse cultural backgrounds. Social acceptability classification models help ensure that AI systems respect cultural norms and avoid actions that may be considered inappropriate or offensive. However, many existing models lack adaptability to different cultures, leading to misinterpretations and potential harm.

This study focuses on developing a social acceptability classification (SAC) model that adapts to various cultural contexts. By incorporating human feedback and advanced techniques such as prompt engineering and simulated reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), we aim to enhance the model's performance across diverse settings.

## 2. Dataset and Evaluation Framework

### 2.1 Dataset Creation

We created a comprehensive dataset comprising 50 data entries, focusing on three cultures: Japan, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. Each entry includes:

- **Interaction ID**
- **Culture**
- **User Message**: A statement or action description.
- **Ground Truth Label**: Acceptable (1), Neutral (0), or Unacceptable (-1) within the cultural context.
- **Cultural Context Explanation**

The dataset captures various social interactions, highlighting how the same action can be perceived differently across cultures.

### 2.2 Evaluation Framework

We evaluated the models using the following steps:

1. **Baseline Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance without cultural context.
2. **Baseline Model with Human Feedback**: Introduced explicit cultural guidelines in the model's prompts.
3. **Simulated RLHF Implementation**: Enhanced the model using a simulated RLHF approach.

We used accuracy as the primary metric to measure model performance, along with precision, recall, and F1-score for a comprehensive evaluation.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Baseline Model Evaluation

#### 3.1.1 Model Selection

We used the GPT-3.5 language model for evaluation due to its extensive pre-trained knowledge and language understanding capabilities.

#### 3.1.2 Evaluation Procedure

- **Input**: User messages without any cultural context.
- **Process**: The model predicts the social acceptability of actions based on general social norms.
- **Output**: The model's prediction is compared with the ground truth label.

### 3.2 Baseline Model with Human Feedback

#### 3.2.1 Incorporating Cultural Guidelines

We modified the model's system prompts to include explicit cultural guidelines for each culture. For example:

- **Japan**: Emphasized respect for hierarchy and avoidance of direct confrontation.
- **United States**: Highlighted individuality and acceptance of direct communication.
- **Saudi Arabia**: Noted the importance of tradition and respect for hierarchy.

#### 3.2.2 Evaluation Procedure

- **Input**: User messages with cultural guidelines in the system prompt.
- **Process**: The model predicts social acceptability considering the provided cultural context.
- **Output**: Predictions are compared with ground truth labels to assess improvement.

### 3.3 Implementing Simulated RLHF

#### 3.3.1 Simulating Human Feedback

Since real-time model fine-tuning was not feasible, we simulated RLHF by:

- **Simulated Feedback**: Assuming that the ground truth labels represent human feedback.
- **Reward Model**: Training a secondary model to predict the quality of the language model's outputs.

#### 3.3.2 Training the Reward Model

- **Feature Extraction**: Used embeddings for user messages and model predictions.
- **Model Training**: Trained a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict positive or negative feedback.
- **Evaluation**: The reward model achieved an accuracy of 80% in predicting feedback.

#### 3.3.3 Adjusting Model Predictions

- **Candidate Generation**: Generated multiple model outputs for each input.
- **Selection**: Used the reward model to select the best output based on predicted feedback.
- **Final Output**: The adjusted predictions were evaluated against ground truth labels.

## 4. Experimental Results

### 4.1 Quantitative Analysis

#### 4.1.1 Baseline Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: 42%
- **Observation**: The model struggled to accurately predict social acceptability without cultural context, especially for non-Western cultures.

#### 4.1.2 Baseline Model with Human Feedback

- **Accuracy**: 68%
- **Improvement**: Incorporating cultural guidelines significantly enhanced the model's performance.

#### 4.1.3 Implementing Simulated RLHF

- **Reward Model Accuracy**: 80%
- **Accuracy with Adjusted Predictions**: 72%
- **Observation**: The adjusted predictions further improved accuracy, indicating better alignment with cultural norms.

### 4.2 Qualitative Analysis

#### 4.2.1 Baseline Model Errors

- **Example**: The model deemed expressing disagreement with a superior as acceptable in Japan and Saudi Arabia, contrary to cultural norms.
- **Analysis**: Highlights the model's bias towards Western cultural norms in the absence of explicit context.

#### 4.2.2 Improvements with Cultural Guidelines

- **Example**: After incorporating guidelines, the model correctly identified that directly confronting a superior is unacceptable in Japan and Saudi Arabia.
- **Analysis**: Demonstrates the model's ability to adapt when provided with specific cultural information.

#### 4.2.3 Adjustments Using Simulated RLHF

- **Example**: The model produced multiple outputs, and the reward model successfully selected the response that aligned with cultural expectations.
- **Analysis**: Showcases the effectiveness of the reward model in refining the model's predictions.

## 5. Limitations

- **Simulated Feedback**: The lack of real human feedback may limit the accuracy of the reward model.
- **Model Constraints**: Inability to fine-tune the underlying language model restricts the application of RLHF techniques.
- **Cultural Nuance**: Cultural guidelines may oversimplify complex cultural norms, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions.
- **Resource Intensive**: Generating embeddings and multiple model outputs increases computational costs and time.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Work

This study demonstrates that incorporating cultural context significantly enhances the performance of social acceptability classification models. By introducing explicit cultural guidelines and implementing a simulated RLHF approach, we improved the model's accuracy from 42% to 72%.

Future work could focus on:

- **Collecting Real Human Feedback**: Gathering feedback from individuals within the respective cultures to improve the reward model.
- **Extending Cultural Coverage**: Including a broader range of cultures to enhance global applicability.
- **Fine-Tuning Language Models**: Exploring models that allow fine-tuning to implement RLHF more effectively.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring that cultural representations are accurate and avoid reinforcing stereotypes.
