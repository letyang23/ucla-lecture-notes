Multimedia Pipeline: Acquisition → Authoring → Compression → Streaming → Consumption
Digital = 1s/0s, allows mix media, large data → compression.
Acquisition defines Quality + Quantity.

ADC: Analog → Digital = Sampling + Quantization.
Sampling: pick values every T sec; fs=1/T.
High fs → high fidelity, more data.
Low fs → less data, possible loss.
Quantization: map amplitude to discrete levels.
B bits → 2^B levels.
High B → better precision, more data.
Error ≤ ½ interval.
Bitrate = B × fs (bits/sec).

Sampling Theorem: fs ≥ 2×fmax.
Voice: 8 kHz; Hearing: 44.1 kHz for CDs.
Use Fourier Transform to find fmax.
Choose B so error not noticeable (voice 8 bit, music 16 bit).

Aliasing: fs < 2×fmax → distortion.
Audio: muffled; Image: jaggies, moiré; Video: wagon wheel.
Fix = low-pass filter (blur) before downsample.

Video Basics:
Sync: NTSC 30 fps (60 Hz), PAL 25 fps (50 Hz).
Flicker fix: Interlaced scan → 60 fields/s.
Color: YUV = Y (luma) + UV (chroma).
B/W TVs use Y only.
Eyes sensitive to Y → subsample UV.
YUV 4:4:4 = 24 bpp, 4:2:2 = 16 bpp, 4:2:0 = 12 bpp.
Aspect ratio: 4:3 vs 16:9.
Fixes: stretch (no), letterbox (ok), seam carving (best).
