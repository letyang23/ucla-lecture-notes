###### Multimedia Processing Pipeline

- Audio  
- Image  
- Video  
- Text  
- Tactile  
- 2D graphics  
- 3D graphics  

##### **Authoring → Compression → Distribution → Devices** 

#### Authoring

Digital:

- Capture  
- Editing  
- ...  

#### Compression

Methods:

- Software
- Hardware
- Compression

Examples of formats:

- MP3  
- HEVC  
- MP4 ...

> Storage (CD, DVD are kinds of storage) happens between *Authoring* and *Compression*.  

#### Distribution

- Satellite  
- Radio tower  
- Ethernet, Network'
- Wires ...

> Business Logic like advertising, encryption/DRM, subscriber management happen between Compression and Distribution

#### Devices

- TV

MEDIAA TTYYPPEESS –– CCOONNCCLLUUSSIIOONN
We have seen a lot of media types that are currently
used; there may be others in future depending on
 Need for information
 Capture device technologies
 Rendering devices and technologies
Need for standards
 Many media types, having many formats
 Information has to be easily interchanged and
displayed
