###### How to be #1?

### THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION

#### Q. How do I get to number one in Google search results?

**Google’s organic search results are produced by a proprietary algorithm that is often being changed, so there are never any guarantees that someone will continue to be highly ranked**

*But there are lots of people ready to give you advice*

<img src="2. SE advertising.assets/image-20250503174247938.png" alt="image-20250503174247938" style="zoom:80%;" />



###### 'SEO'

### Search Engine Optimization

- **There is an industry of companies whose focus is to develop and refine a company’s online presence;**
   – They are called Search Engine Optimizers
- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO) involves:**
   – Making pages show up higher in search engine’s organic results
   – Optimizing content to target certain keyword phrases
   – Developing web page content that responds to each seeker’s interests
- **There are many companies who claim to do SEO**
   – For a list see http://www.topseos.com/rankings-of-best-seo-companies
   – Generally they are “small” companies, earning under $10 million per year

###### HERE is how to (try to) be #1: PAY UP!

### **THE MILLION DOLLAR ANSWER**

**Q. How do I get to number one in Google?**
 **A. Use paid search**

**Paid search** is one answer; Google and many other search engines use the pay-per-click (PPC) model of advertising.

Pay enough for a click and you can pretty much guarantee to get a top spot on the list of ads for your chosen keywords

<img src="2. SE advertising.assets/image-20250503174445864.png" alt="image-20250503174445864" style="zoom:80%;" />



###### 'Google Ads'

[This](https://business.google.com/us/google-ads/) is where advertisers go/start; [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV4DCdyLNgU) is a basic explainer video.

### **Lets Take a Close Look at Google Adwords**

*Renamed as Google Ads*
 Google’s program for accepting pay-per-click ads.
 Its home page is https://ads.google.com

For every keyword phrase there is an auction where bidders agree to pay a certain amount to Google if their ad is clicked on;

<img src="2. SE advertising.assets/image-20250503174537583.png" alt="image-20250503174537583" style="zoom:80%;" />



### Campaigns Begin By Choosing Keywords: Google Keyword Estimator

For specific keywords Google provides the approximate cost per click and the resulting position in the list, and other stats

<img src="2. SE advertising.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 6.19.18 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 6.19.18 PM" style="zoom:80%;" />

**Long Tailed Keywords can be Valuable**

- Long-tail keywords are search queries made up of three-four word phrases that are very specific to a product, good, or service that’s being sold.
  - Long-tail keywords are the phrases search engine users are generally more likely to type in when they’re closer to purchasing an item.
- The conversion rate for long-tail keywords is approximately **2.5 times higher than it is for head (shorter) keywords.**
- Long-tail keywords that present *less* competition also offer *lower cost-per-click prices* since few marketers are targeting them.

<img src="2. SE advertising.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 6.20.08 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 6.20.08 PM" style="zoom:80%;" />

### Your Keyword Phrases Should be Mapped on Your Website

- **Use key phrases in the content on your page**
- **Develop metadata that includes key phrases in:**
  - TITLE tags
  - Meta Description and Keyword tags
  - ALT tags
- **Name directories, files and images with the same key words or phrases**

- **Query: “Levi’s men’s clothing jeans”** produces the URL
   **https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/clothing/men/jeans/c/levi_clothing_men_jeans/**
- **Query: “Ladies handbags”**
   **https://www.neimanmarcus.com/c/handbags-all-handbags-evening-bags-cat35400731/**

(*Notice how folder names mimic the data they contain*)



###### Keyword MATCHING...

### **Advertisers Designate Keyword Matching Rules**

- **The *advertiser* will specify the type of matching to be done against his keyword phrases**
   – *Four types of keyword matching options can help you refine your ad targeting*

1. **Broad Match**
2. **Exact Match**
3. **Phrase Match**
4. **Negative Keyword**



### **Keyword: Broad Match**

- **A broad match is the default option**
  - When you include keyword phrases like "tennis shoes" in your keyword list, your ads will appear when users search for "tennis" and "shoes", in any order (and possibly along with other terms)
- **Broad Match ads may also show for expanded matches, including synonyms and plurals**
  - Google will analyze your keyword list, ad text, and daily Google search queries, and show your ads for relevant terms and variations (such as "tennis sneakers")
    - Even if you didn't include these terms in your keyword list
- **Broad matches are often less targeted than exact or phrase matches**
  - If you decide to run your ads on broad-matched keywords, create keyword phrases containing at least two descriptive words

https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2497828



### **Keyword: Exact Match**

- **The search query must exactly match your keyword**

  - Originally Exact Match meant that "tennis shoes" would only match a user request for "tennis shoes" and not for "red tennis shoes," even though the second query contains your keywords

  - However, Google now includes rewording and reordering for exact match keywords

  - Exact match will now ignore function words (in, to), conjunctions (for, but), articles (a, the) and other words that don’t impact the intent of the query

    <img src="2. SE advertising.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 6.23.59 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 6.23.59 PM" style="zoom:80%;" />

https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2497825



### **Keyword: Phrase Match**

- **Your ad appears when users search on the exact phrase**
  - AND when their search contains additional terms
    - As long as the keyword phrase is in exactly the same order
  - A phrase match for "tennis shoes" would include "red tennis shoes" but not "shoes for tennis"

https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2407784



### **Keyword: Negative Keyword**

- **Negative keywords allow you to eliminate searches that you know are not related to your message**
  - *If you add the negative keyword "-table" to your keyword "tennis shoes," your ad will not appear when a user searches on "table tennis shoes"**
    - Negative keywords should be used with caution, -- they can eliminate a large portion of a desired audience if applied incorrectly

###### Ad servers

### **Capabilities of Search Engine Ad Servers**

- **The typical common functionality of ad servers includes:**
  - Uploading the creative (*creative* is the term used to describe the ad that will appear)
  - Maintaining business rules for placing ads
  - Targeting ads to different users or content
  - Optimizing appearance of a set of creatives based upon results (choosing the most effective ad)
  - Reporting impressions, clicks, post-click activities, and interaction metrics.

- **Advanced functionality may include:**
  - Frequency capping* creatives so users only see messages a limited amount of time.
  - *Sequencing* creatives so users see messages in a specific order (sometimes known as surround sessions).
  - Excluding competitive creatives so users do not see competitors' ads directly next to one another.
  - Displaying creatives so an advertiser can own 100% of the inventory on a page (sometimes known as roadblocks).
  - Targeting creatives to users based on their previous behavior (behavioral marketing or behavioral targeting).



### **Search Engine Ad Servers are Versatile**

- **Advertisers with accounts on Google’s Ads can define a set of criteria for placement of their ad; typical criteria might include rules such as**
  - Only display my ad
    - from 9:00AM–5:00PM EST
    - once/day
    - if the viewer is located in the United States
  - *dayparting* is a technique that involves increasing your bids during times when conversion rates are typically above average, and decreasing them when rates are typically below average

###### Auctioning/bidding [for placement]

### Google Ads Auction Rules

- **Each bidder specifies (i) search terms that trigger its bid and (ii) the amount to bid for each search term.**
  - Bidders may also establish an overall ad budget and limits for each kind of bid.
  - Google may set a reserve or minimum price for each term.
- **Google estimates the “click-through rate” that each bidder would have if it were listed in the first spot.**
  - Ads with very low click-through rates are not displayed.
  - Google ranks bids by multiplying the click-through-rate and the bid amount.
  - Ads are displayed in rank order.
- **Google is paid only when an ad gets clicked.**
  - In that case, the price it receives is *the smallest price the bidder could have bid to get its ranking*.



### Let P(C) be the Probability of the Ad Being Clicked

```
Bid2:  $9     P(C) = 0.1     →     $0.9  
Bid3:  $6     P(C) = 0.1     →     $0.6  
Bid1:  $5     P(C) = 0.4     →     $2.0  ← Expected Revenue
```

P(C) can depend upon:

- Historical click performance of the ad
- Landing page quality
- Relevance to the user
- User click through rates

**Expected Revenue = Bid amount × Click Probability**
 *So the ad with highest bid does not necessarily produce the most revenue*



### Google Ranks Ads by the Product of Bid Amount × Click Probability

```
Bid1:  $5    P(C) = 0.4     →   is placed 1st  
Bid2:  $9    P(C) = 0.1     →   is placed 2nd  
Bid3:  $6    P(C) = 0.1     →   is placed 3rd  
```

**Ad Rank = Bid × Click Probability**



###### Ad 'campaigns'

- **Ads advertisers create advertising campaigns**
  - There are two campaigns defined above

- **Each campaign has a set of keyword and associated ads, and includes**
  - a budget, recorded clicks, recorded impressions, click thru rate, average cost/click, and total cost of the campaign

###### Adsense [ANOTHER mechanism to serve ads!]

###### The big idea - place ads in [non-biz] pages people visit: https://adsense.google.com/start/

### AdSense

- **AdSense** from Google is a service for placing Google ads on third party web pages
- Google purchased the content matching technology from Oingo, a small Santa Monica-based search engine in 2003 for $102 million
- The program is designed for website publishers who want to display targeted text, video or image advertisements on their website pages and earn money when site visitors view or click the ads
- Typically Google keeps 32% of the ad revenue and returns 68% to the website developer
- In addition to cost-per-click ads, Google also offers
  - *Cost per Thousand* displays, CPM
  - *Cost per Engagement*, where advertisers only pay when users actively engage with ads, e.g. hovering over them or expanding them or reviewing the landing page for more than a few seconds
- **Typically blogs use AdSense to monetize their site**



### How AdSense Works

1. The webmaster inserts the AdSense JavaScript code into a webpage.
2. Each time this page is visited, the JavaScript code uses inlined JSON to display content fetched from Google's servers.
3. Google's servers use a cache of the page to determine a set of high-value keywords. Ads are served for those keywords based on the AdWords bidding system.
4. For site-targeted ads, the advertiser chooses the page(s) on which to display ads, and pays based on CPM, or the price advertisers choose to pay for every thousand advertisements displayed.
5. Search ads are added to the list of results after the visitor performs a search.
6. To protect against fraud, AdSense customers can specify the pages on which ads should be shown. AdSense then ignores clicks from pages other than those specified.



### AdSense Ads on Websites are Not Always Relevant

Google’s **AdSense** program claims to place ads on third-party websites, where the ads are **relevant** to the site’s content;

Each time a visitor visits a page with an AdSense tag, a piece of JavaScript writes an iframe tag, whose `src` attribute includes the URL of the page. Google's servers use a cache of the page to determine a set of high-value keywords.

 Above, an article about Michael Jackson includes an irrelevant ad about payday loans



###### Serving ads - remains a BIG business...

### Adsense Content Matching Originally Based on WordNet

- **AdSense technology is based upon a database of word meanings initially developed at Princeton, called WordNet**
   – https://wordnet.princeton.edu/

- **WordNet is a semantic lexicon for the English language.**
   It groups English words into sets of synonyms called *synsets*, provides short, general definitions, and records the various semantic relations between these synonym sets.

  - The purpose is twofold:

    1. to produce a combination of dictionary and thesaurus that is more intuitively usable, and
    2. to support automatic text analysis.
