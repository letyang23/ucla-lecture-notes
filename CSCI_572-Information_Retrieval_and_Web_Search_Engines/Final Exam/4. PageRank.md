## Bibliometrics - PageRank's influence 

### History of Link Analysis

- Bibliometrics has been active since at least the 1960°s 
- A definition from Wikipedia: 
- "**Bibliometrics** is a set of methods to quantitatively analyze academic literature. Citation analysis and content analysis are commonly used **bibliometric** methods. While **bibliometric** methods are most often used in the ficld of library and information science, **bibliometrics** have wide applications in other areas.” 
- Many research fields use bibliometric methods to explore 
  - the impact of their field, 
  - the impact of a set of researchers, or 
  - the impact of a particular paper. 

### Bibliometrics

- One common technique of Bibliometrics is citation analysis 
- **Citation analysis** is the examination of the frequency, patterns, and graphs of citations in articles and books. 
- citation analysis can obscrve links to other works or other researchers. 
- **Bibliographic coupling**: two papers that cite many of the same papers 
- **Co-citation**: two papers that were cited by many of the same papers 
- **Impact factor (of a journal)**: frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year or period

### Bibliographic Coupling

- Measure of similarity of documents introduced by Kessler of MIT in 1963. 
- The bibliographic coupling of two documents A and B is the number of documents cited by *both* A and B. 
- Size of the intersection of their bibliographies. 
- Maybe want to normalize by size of bibliographies?

### Journal Impact Factor

- Developed by Garfield in 1972 to measure the importance (quality, influence) of scientific journals. 
- Measure of how often papers in the journal are cited by other scientists. 
- Computed and published annually by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). 
  - It is now owned by Thomson Reuters 
- The **impact factor** of a journal J in year Y is the average number of citations (from indexed documents published in year Y) to a paper published in J in year Y-1 or Y-2.
- Does not account for the quality of the citing article

### Citation Graph

- The structure of this graph, independent of content, can provide interesting information about the similarity of documents and the structure of information

Note that academic citations nearly always refer to the author's eariler work.

###### But... web page links != paper 'links' 

### Citations vs. Web Links

- Web links are a bit different than citations: 
  - Many links are navigational
  - Many pages with high in-degree are portals not content providers 
  - Not all links are endorsements 
  - Company websites normally don’t point to their competitors 
  - Citations to relevant literature is enforced by peer-review 



## PageRank - simple (‘essence’) version 

### What is PageRank?

+ PageRank is a **web link analysis algorithm** introduced by Google 
+ PageRank was developed at Stanford University by Google founders **Larry Page and Sergey Brin** 
  + The paper describing PageRank was co-authored by Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd 
+ PageRank is a “**vote**”, by all the other pages on the Web, about how important a page is. 
+ A link to a page counts as a vote of support. 
+ If there’s no link there’s no support (but it’s an abstention from voting rather than a vote against the page). 
+ PageRank says <u>nothing</u> about the content or size of a page, the language it’s written in, or the text used in the anchor of'a link! 
+ Looked at another way, PageRank is a **probability distribution** used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page 

### Page Rank Patented

- A copy of the front page of the patent of the PageRank algorithm; Larry Page is credited as the inventor; the patent was awarded to Stanford University; the patent was filed January 1998 
- The PageRank patent expired in 2017. Google holds a perpetual license to the patent. 
- Google has never pursued other search engine companies for using the PageRank algorithm 

https://patents.google.com/patent/US6285999B1/en

### Initial Page Rank Formulation

$PR(u) = \sum_{v \in in(u)}\frac{PR(v)}{|out(v)|}$

- "the PageRank value for a page **u** is dependent on the PageRank values for each page **v** contained in the set **in(u)** (the set of all pages linking to page **u**), divided by the number **|out(v)|** of outgoing links from page **v**"

### Steps for Simplifed Algorithm

1. **Iteration 0**: Initialize all ranks to be 1/(number of total pages). 
2. **Iteration 1**: For each page **u**, update **u**’s rank to be the sum of each incoming page **v**’s rank from the previous iteration, divided by the number total number of links from page **v**. 



## An example

### The Simplifed PageRank Algorithm

**Example 1**

1. **Iteration 0**: Initialize all pages to have rank ⅕.
2. **Iteration 1**:
3. **P₁**: has 1 link from P₃, and P₃ has 4 outbound links, so we take the rank of P₃ from iteration 0 and divide it by 4, which results in rank (⅕)/4 = **1/20** for P₁
    **PR(P₁) = (⅕)/4 = 1/20**
4. **P₂**: has 2 links from P₁ and P₃. P₁ has 1 outbound link and P₃ has 4 outbound links, so we take (the rank of P₁ from iteration 0 and divide it by 1) and add that to (the rank of P₃ from iteration 0 and divide that by 4) to get ⅕ + 1/20 = **5/20** for P₂
    **PR(P₂) = ⅕ + (⅕)/4 = 5/20**

|      | Iteration 0 | Iteration 1 |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
| P₁   | 1/5         | 1/20        |
| P₂   | 1/5         | 5/20        |
| P₃   | 1/5         | 1/10        |
| P₄   | 1/5         | 5/20        |
| P₅   | 1/5         | 7/20        |

##### Example 1: After 2 Iterations

| Page | Iteration 0 | Iteration 1 | Iteration 2 | Final Rank |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| P₁   | 1/5         | 1/20        | 1/40        | 5          |
| P₂   | 1/5         | 5/20        | 3/40        | 4          |
| P₃   | 1/5         | 1/10        | 5/40        | 3          |
| P₄   | 1/5         | 5/20        | 15/40       | 2          |
| P₅   | 1/5         | 7/20        | 16/40       | 1          |

PR(P₅) = ⅕ + ⅕ * ¼ + ⅕ * ½ = 7/20



## An[other] example

### Another Example

##### Example 2

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.56.00 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.56.00 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Say we have four pages: **A**, **B**, **C** and **D**. 
- Links from a page to itself are ignored (there aren't any in this example). 
- Multiple links from one page to another are treated as a single link.
- In this example, every page would start out with a rank of 0.25 

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.56.20 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.56.20 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Since B, C, and D all have outbound links to A, the D Pagerank of A will be **0.75** upon the first iteration 
  - (B with rank of 0.25) + (C with rank of 0.25) +  (D with rank of 0.25) would transfer all of B . A those ranks to A 
- But wait! What about ranks of pages B,C, and D? Because B, C, and D have no incoming edges and they give all their rank to A, they will all end up with a rank of 0. This doesn't add upto 1...
- **So the simplified algorithm needs to be able to handle border cases, so we must generalize the PageRank algorithm!**

## PageRank - Fuller version [with 'MBI'!] 

### Complete PageRank Algorithm

- Quoting from the original Google paper, PageRank is defined like this: 
  - "We assume page A has pages T1...Tn which point to it (i.e., are citations). The parameter d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1. We usually set d to 0.85. There are more details about d in the next section. Also C(A) is defined as the number of links going out of page A."
    The PageRank of a page A is given as follows: 
    $PR(A) = (1-d) +d (PR(T1)/C(T1) +... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn)) $
- Note: 
  - That the PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages, so the sum of all web pages' PageRanks will be one. 

### Explanation

$PR(A) = (1-d) +d (PR(T1)/C(T1) +... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn)) $

- PR(A) is PageRank of Page A (one we want to calculate) 
- PR(T1) is the PageRank of Site T1 pointing to page A 
- C(T1) is the number of outgoing links of page T1 
- PR(Tn)/C(Tn) : If page A has a backlink from page "Tn" the share of the vote page A will get is "PR(Tn)/C(Tn)" 
- d(...) : All these fractions of votes are added together but, to stop the other pages having too much influence, this total vote is “damped down” by multiplying it by the factor “d”, (0.85)
- (1-d) : Since “sum of all web pages' PageRanks will be one”. Even if the d(...) is 0 then the page will get a small PR of 0.15 

### How PageRank is Calculated

- PR of each page depends on PR of other pages which are pointing to it. But we don’t know PR of a given page until the PR of other pages is calculated and so on... 
- From the Google paper:
  - PageRank or PR(A) can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm, and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web 
- What this means is that we can calculate the PR without knowing the final PR of other pages 
  - Recurrence Relation: an equation that recursively defines a sequence of values once one or more initial terms are given; 
- We calculate PR iteratively a number of times until we start converging to the same value. 

### How Fast Does the PageRank Algorithm Converge

- Early experiments on e Convergence of PageRank Computation Google used 322 million links
- PR (322 Million Links): 52 iterations
- PR (161 Million Links): 45 iterations
- Number of iterations required for convergence is empirically (but not formally derived) O(log n) (where n is the number of links)
- Hence the calculation is quite efficient

## PR computation, via iteration 

### Computing PageRank by Iteration Example

- Consider 2 pages: Page A and Page B pointing to each other. 

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.26.42 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.26.42 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- C(A) =1, number of outgoing links of A 
- C(B) =1, number of outgoing links of B 
- What should be the initial value of P(A) or P(B) ? 

### Guess 1:

- Suppose the initial values are :
  - P(A) =1 and P(B) =1 and d= 0.85; then 
    - $PR(A)= (1 — d) + d*(PR(B)/1)$
    - $PR(B)= (1 — d) + d*(PR(A)/1)$
- i.e. 
  - $PR(A)=0.15+0.85* 1 =1$ 
  - $PR(B)=0.15+0.85*1 =1$ 
  - In one iteration we are done 
  - Let’s try another set of initial values. 

### Guess 2 with 3 Iterations

- Initial Values : P(A) =0, P(B) = 0 and d= 0.85 

  - $PR(A)= (1 — d) + d*(PR(B)/1)$

  - $PR(B)= (1 — d) + d*(PR(A)/1)$

- $PR(A)=0.15+0.85 * 0 =0.15$ 

  $PR(B)= 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.15 = 0.2775 $

- Iterating again we get: 
  - $PR(A)=0.15+0.85 * 0.2775 = 0.385875$ 
  - $PR(B)= 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.385875 = 0.47799375$
- And iterating again 
  - $PR(A)=0.15+ 0.85 * 0.47799375 = 0.5562946875$
  - $PR(B)=0.15 + 0.85 * 0.5562946875 = 0.62285048437$ 

### Guess 2: Continued...

- After 20 iterations... 
  - PR(A)=0.99
  - PR(B)=0.99 
- Both approaching to 1 

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.27.03 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.27.03 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Guess 3:

- Initial Values : P(A) = 40 and P(B) = 40 d=0.85 
- $PR(A)= (1 - d) + d(PR(B)/1) $
- $PR(B)= (1 - d) + d(PR(A)/1) $
- Notice decreasing value of PR
- The page rank is again approachingto 1. 

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.27.14 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.27.14 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- So it doesn’t matter where you start your guess, once the PageRank calculations have settled down, the "normalized probability distribution" (the average PageRank for these two pages) will be 1.0

###### The last three slides might seem confusing - because they use the current (rather than previous) values of PR(A), to calculate PR(B). "Technically" we ARE supposed to be using PR(A) and PR(B) from the previous step, to update them for the current step. We can 'get away with' being careless/sloppy because... it doesn't matter (which we use - previous or current values)! After enough steps, either way will result in correct, converged PR values.

###### The following screengrabs illustrate the "proper" way of using prior values, but, with arbitrary starting values to show they don't matter.

## Convergence 

### PageRank Convergence?

- Some observations about the damping factor 
- The damping factor value and its effect: 
  - For certain graphs the simple update rule can cause pagerank to accumulate and get stuck in certain parts of the graph 
    - E.g. if a page has no outgoing links to other pages, itis called a sink 
    - The simplified pagerank algorithm can get stuck in sinks 
  - This is fixed by having each node on every round 
    - Give a d fraction of its pagerank to its neighbors 
    - Give a `(1-d)` fraction of its pagerank to everyone in the graph 
    - As a result, pages with no incoming links will get some pagerank 
  - If too high, more iterations are required 
  - If too low, you get repeated over-shoot,
  -  Both above and below the average — the numbers just swing like pendulum and never settle down. 



## A bunch of examples [PR for different link graphs]

### Examples of Relative PageRanks 1:

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.24.19 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.24.19 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observations:
  - Every page has at least a PR of 0.15 to start out 
  - Page D has no votes but still it has a PR of 0.15 
  - It is believed that Google undergoes a post-spidering phase whereby any pages that have no incoming links at all are ignored wrt PageRank 

### Example 2: Simple hierarchy with Some Outgoing Links

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.24.31 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.24.31 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observations: 
  - Home has the most PR 
  - But average PR is 0.378 
    - “External site” pages are not voting for anyone. 
  - Links within your own site can have a significant effect on PageRank. 

### Example 3: Linking External Sites Back into our Home Page

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.24.43 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.24.43 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observations:
  - Comparing this example with the previous one, now the Pagerank of the Home Page has increased significantly. 
  - Moreover, the average PageRank is better because of all the external sites linking back to the home page. 

### Example 4: Simple Hierarchy

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.24.54 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.24.54 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observations: 
  - Home Page has PageRank of 2.5 times the page rank of its child pages. 
  - A hierarchy structure concentrates votes and PageRank into one page. 

### Example 5: Hierarchical - But with One Link In and One Out

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.04 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.04 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observations: 
  - The PageRank of Home page has increased from 1.92 (Previous Example) to 3.31
  - Site A contributed 0.85 PR to Home page and the raised PageRank in the “About”, “Product” and “More” pages has had a lovely "feedback" effect, pushing up the home page’s PageRank even further! 
- A well structured site will amplify the effect of any contributed PR. 

### Example 6: Looping

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.19 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.19 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observations: 
  - All the pages have the same number of incoming links, i.e. all pages are of equal importance to each other. 
  - Each page has PR of 1.0 
  - Average PR is 1.0

### Example 7: Looping - But with a Link in and a Link Out

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.31 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.31 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observauons: 
  - PageRank of our home page has gone up a little, but what’s happened to the "More" page? Its PageRank has gone down 
  - Now the Pagerank value of the external Site B is equal to the "More" page. 
  - The vote of the “Product” page has been split evenly between “More” page and the external site B. 
  - This is good for Site B for otherwise its PageRank would be 0.15 

### Example 8: Extensive Interlinking or Fully Meshed

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.41 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.41 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observations: 
  - All pages are of equal importance to each other so the resulting PageRank is no different than what was gotten in Example 6

### Example 9: Fully Meshed - But with One Vote in and One Vote Out

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.51 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.25.51 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observations: 
  - "Product" page has kept three quarters of its vote within our site unlike example 9 where it was giving away fully half of it’s vote to the external site! 
  - Keeping just this small extra fraction of the vote within our site has had a very nice effect on the Home Page too. 

### Example 10: Previous ... Next... Documentation Page Layout

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.26.00 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.26.00 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- The first page of the document has a higher PR than the Home Page! This is because page B is getting all the vote from page A, but page A is only getting fractions of pages B, C and D. 
- In order to give users of your site a good experience, you may have to take a hit against your PR 

### Example 11: Getting Higher PR the Wrong Way!

<img src="4. PageRank.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.26.23 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 11.26.23 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Observations:
  - 1000 incoming links and only one outgoing link 
  - It doesn’t matter how many pages you have in your site, your average PR will always be 1.0 at best. 
  - But a hierarchical layout can strongly concentrate votes, and therefore the PR, into the home page! 
  - This is a technique used by some disreputable sites 

**A link farm** is set of web pages created with the sole aim of linking to a target page in an attempt to improve that page's search engine ranking. 



## Suggs for getting a good PR 

### Some Suggestions Based on What We Have Seen in Examples.

- Suggestions for improving your page rank 
  - Increasing the internal links in your site can minimize the damage to your PR when you give away votes by linking to external sites. 
  - Ifa particular page is highly important - use a hierarchical structure with the important page at the “top”. 
  - Where a group of pages may contain outward links 
  - increase the number of internal links to retain as much PR as possible. 
  - Where a group of pages do not contain outward links 
  - the number of internal links in the site has no effect on the site’s average PR. You might as well use a link structure that gives the user the best navigational experience. 
  - **Use Site Maps**: Linking to a sitc map on each page increases the number of internal links in the site, spreading the PR out and protecting you against your vote “donations” to other sites 



## PR - just one of many 'signals' used by the Google SE 

- PageRank is just one factor Google uses to determine a page’s relevance. It assumes that people will link to your page only if they think the page is good. But this is not always true. 
- Content is still the king!!! 
  - Anchor, body, title tags etc. still are very important for search engines 
- From Chris Ridings’ Paper, “PageRank Uncovered” (http://www.voelspriet2.nl/PageRank.pdf): 
  - You must do enough "on the page" work and/or anchor text work to get into that subset of top pages for your chosen key phrase, otherwise your high PageRank will be completely in vain. 
- PageRank is a multiplier factor. 
  - If Google wants to penalize any page they can set the PageRank equal to a small number, even 0. As a result it will be pushed down on the search results page.
