# Knowledge graphs

### **Outline**

- **Basic definitions:** Taxonomy, Ontology, Knowledgebase
- **Knowledgebase Internals and Examples**
- **WordNet**
- **Wikipedia**
- **Google’s Knowledge Graph**



### **What is a Taxonomy?**	

τάξις (taxis) = "arrangement"

νόμος (nomos) = "law"

- A taxonomy is a **classifÍÍication** or **categorization** of a complex system.

### What is an Ontology

- a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them, or
- a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can exist for an agent or a community of agents, or
- a body of formally represented knowledge based on a *conceptualization*: the objects, concepts, and other entities that are assumed to exist in some area of interest and the relationships that hold among them

### What is a Knowledgebase

- A **knowledgebase** (KB) is a technology used to store and retrieve complex structured and unstructured information as stored in an ontology
  - Two components:
    1. a way of *representing* information and
    2. a method for *reasoning* about the information
- A **knowledgebase** is a collection of information stored in an ontology that includes software used to author and present that information



### KnowledgeBases – Developed by AI Community

- **To move away from just using keyword matching, search engines borrowed techniques developed by AI researchers**
- A *knowledgebase* (KB) is a technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system.
- A **knowledge-based system consists of two elements**:
  1. a *knowledgebase* that *represents* facts about the world, and
  2. an *inference engine* that can *reason* about those facts (and use rules and other forms of logic to deduce new facts or highlight inconsistencies)
- **The term "knowledgebase" was coined to distinguish this form of knowledge store from the more common and widely used term \*database\***
  - Is a relational database a knowledgebase?
- *Examples of knowledgebases: Freebase, Google’s Knowledge Graph, Apple’s Siri, IBM’s Watson*



### Inferencing on KnowledgeBases

- An *inference engine* is a component of a system that applies logical rules to a knowledgebase to deduce new information
- This process is ongoing as each new fact in the knowledgebase can trigger additional rules in the inference engine
- Inference engines work primarily in one of two modes: forward chaining and backward chaining
  - **Forward chaining** starts with the known facts and asserts new facts
  - **Backward chaining** starts with goals, and works backward to determine what facts must be asserted so that the goals can be achieved
- An inference engine cycles through three sequential steps: match rules, select rules, and execute rules
- The execution of the rules will sometimes result in new facts or goals being added to the knowledgebase which will trigger the cycle to repeat. This cycle continues until no new rules can be matched
- Search engines typically use forward chaining



### Forward Chaining

- **Forward chaining** is the repeated application of modus ponens
- In propositional logic, *modus ponens* is the rule
  - “*P* implies *Q*” and “*P*” are both asserted to be true, so therefore *Q* must be true
  - Sometimes modus ponens is written as ((*P* → *Q*) and *P*) → *Q*
  - For example:
    - **If today is Tuesday, then John will go to work.**
    - **Today is Tuesday.**
    - **Therefore, John will go to work.**
- Forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data until a goal or endpoint is reached



### **Binary Relations and Instances**

Here are some sample binary relations with their type signature, e.g.
   *hasAdvisor*: Person × Person
   *graduatedAt*: Person × University
   *bornOn*: Person × Date

Here are instances of the above binary relations
   *hasAdvisor*(JimGray, MikeHarrison)
   *hasAdvisor*(Susan Davidson, Hector García-Molina)
   *graduatedAt*(JimGray, Berkeley)
   *graduatedAt*(HectorGarcia-Molina, Stanford)
   *bornOn*(JohnLennon, 9-Oct-1940)

### **Types of Knowledge For a KnowledgeBase**

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 6.57.33 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 6.57.33 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Taxonomies are narrower than ontologies since ontologies include a larger variety of relation types. Mathematically, a hierarchical **taxonomy** is a tree structure of classifications for a given set of objects. An ontology is a directed, labeled, cyclic graph.



### Search Engines Use Knowledgebases to Enhance the Display of Results

- The representation of knowledge in a knowledgebase is an object model
  - Includes classes, subclasses and instances
- A **taxonomy** is usually only a hierarchy of concepts (i.e. the *only relation* between the concepts is parent/child, or subClass/superClass, or broader/narrower)
- In a **knowledgebase**, *arbitrary complex relations* between concepts can be expressed as well, e.g. (X *marriedTo* Y; or A *worksFor* B; or C *locatedIn* D, etc.)
- Search engines utilize this linked, structured data in many ways, such as
  - Providing direct answers to queries
  - Enhanced displays in many varieties of engaging visual formats, e.g. see query “Picasso” in Google



### **Is Elvis Alive**

(Screenshots from search engines are displayed: Ask.com, Bing.com, Google.com, Wolfram Alpha)

- **Ask.com – Mostly Yes**
- **Bing.com – Yes/Maybe**
- **Google.com – No**
- **Wolfram Alpha – No**

**Conclusion:**
 **2 Yes’es and 2 No’s;
 text matching alone is insufficient
 we need to “understand” the query**



### Close Up: A KnowledgeBase for Elvis

### **Inheritance**

- An important feature of knowledge representation is its organization into *class hierarchies*. Classes can be based on the properties of objects/concepts.
- Inheritance is a relation by which
   – 1. an individual assumes the properties of its class and
   – 2. determines which properties of a class are passed on to its subclass.
- In order to support inheritance, objects/concepts must be organized into classes and classes must be arranged in a generalized hierarchy
   – the most generic object/concept is at the top of the hierarchy and the most specific is at the bottom of the hierarchy.



<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.02.02 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.02.02 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />



### **Some Advantages of Inheritance**

- Inheritance provides a natural mechanism for *representing taxonomically structured knowledge*
- Inheritance provides an economical means of *expressing properties common to a class of objects/concepts*
- Inheritance *guarantees that all members of a class inherit the appropriate properties*, thus ensuring consistency with the class definition
- Inheritance *reduces the size of the knowledge base* as properties are defined once for the most general type of objects/concepts and these properties are then shared by other less generic objects/concepts in the type hierarchy.



### **Different Notations for a KnowledgeBase**

- Resource Description Format (RDF) is a W3C spec used for creating ontologies:
  - https://www.w3.org/RDF/
  - Sometimes "RDF Ontology" and "KnowledgeBase (KB)" are used synonymously.

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.03.35 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.03.35 PM" style="zoom:40%;" />

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.03.52 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.03.52 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />



### **RDF Data Model**

- RDF allows us to make statements about resources.
   The format of these statements is:
   `<subject> <predicate> <object>`
- Some examples:
   `<Bob> <is a> <person>`
   `<Bob> <is a friend of> <Alice>`
   `<Bob> <is born on> <the 4th of July 1990>`
   `<Bob> <is interested in> <the Mona Lisa>`
   `<the Mona Lisa> <was created by> <Leonardo da Vinci>`
   `<the video 'La Joconde à Washington'> <is about> <the Mona Lisa>`
- We can visualize triples as a connected **graph**.
   Graphs consist of nodes and arcs.
   The subjects and objects of the triples make up the nodes in the graph;
   the predicates form the arcs.
- One query language for making inferences on these graphs is **SPARQL**.

### To Answer a Question Knowledgebases Need to Combine Information From *Multiple Sources*

- Extractors take the information from various sources and re-work it into a form consistent with the knowledgebase.

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.05.56 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.05.56 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />



### **KnowledgeBases Can Be Represented as Labeled MultiGraphs**

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.07.35 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.07.35 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

A knowledgebase can be seen as a directed labeled multigraph, where the nodes are entities and the edges relations.

A multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges that have the same end nodes. Two vertices may be connected by more than one edge



### A Single Entity Can Have Different Labels

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.08.10 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.08.10 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### To Build a Knowledgebase One Must Find Classes and Instances

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.08.46 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.08.46 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Two Knowledgebases With Complementary Information

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.09.10 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.09.10 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />



### A Knowledgebase Must Work Across Multiple Ontologies

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.09.39 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.09.39 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### We Need to Match Entities, Classes and Relations

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.10.05 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.10.05 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Combining Elements From Different Knowledgebases Meaning Matching Entities

Build a graph:

- nodes: pairs of entities, weighted with similarity
- edges: weighted with degree of relatedness

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.11.14 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.11.14 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

Iterate until convergence: similarity := weighted sum of neighbor similarities

many variants (belief propagation, label propagation, etc.)

### Semantic Network

- **A semantic network is a knowledge representation scheme that represents knowledge as a graph.**
  - The nodes of the graph correspond to concepts or facts and
  - the arc correspond to relations or associations between concepts.
  - In a semantic network both the nodes and arcs are labeled

### Semantic Network

- A semantic network that defines the properties of snow and ice
- The concept snowman inherits all the properties of snow
- The concept of ice and snow share a number of properties

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.13.22 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.13.22 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />



### Expressing Relationship in Semantic Networks

- The most important link in a semantic network is the is-a link
- A semantic network can organize knowledge in a hierarchy by using the is-a link such that the lower nodes inherit the properties of the higher nodes

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.14.20 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.14.20 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### This is-a relationship in a Semantic Network

### WordNet is a Lexical DataBase with many Classes, Subclasses, and Superclasses

- **WordNet**, developed at Princeton, is a lexical database for the English language.
  - It groups English words into sets of synonyms called **synsets**,
    - provides short definitions and usage examples,
    - records a number of relations among these synonym sets or their members.

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.15.45 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.15.45 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### WordNet Example: Superclass of Person

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.15.02 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.15.02 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

Note the terms:

- hyponym
  - More specific
- Holonym
  - Denoting the whole
- Hypernym
  - A broad or superordinate.



### WordNet Example: Subclass of Singer

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.15.35 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.15.35 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### WordNet Example: Instances But Very Few

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.16.36 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.16.36 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Only 32 singers!?
  - 4 guitarists, 5 scientists, 0 enterprises, 2 entrepreneurs
  - WordNet classes lack instances



### Wikipedia: Tranformation from Database to KnowledgeBase

Wikipedia’s Original Mission Statement

- “Imagine a world in which every person on the planet shares in the sum of all human knowledge. That is what we’re doing.
   (for free, in the language of their choice)”

### Wikipedia’s Scale

- As of April, 2019 Wikipedia’s database when dumped takes up 100GBs compressed, 10TBs uncompressed
- Total wiki pages: 51,000,000+
- Total English articles: 6.1 million
- Unique visitors per month: 500 million
- Monthly mobile page views: 3.7 billion

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.18.17 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.18.17 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### **Wikipedia’s Five Pillars (5P)**

1. **Encyclopaedia**
   - Notable topics
   - No original research (**NOR**)
2. **Neutral point of view **(*NPOV*)
   - **Verifiability** (referencing)
3. **Free content**
   - Anyone can edit
   - No copyright infringements
4. **Be civil**
5. **No firm rules**

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.19.33 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.19.33 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### **Wikipedia Statistics**

- **Among top 10 most visited websites**
- **70% of traffic is from search engines**
- **Cited in hundreds of U.S. court rulings**

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.21.13 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.21.13 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Wikipedia is a Rich Source of Instances

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.21.01 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.21.01 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Wikipedia's Categories Also Contain Classes

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.22.14 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.22.14 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- **But categories do not form a taxonomic hierarchy, i.e. there is no ISA hierarchy**
  - An isa hierarchy only specifies that a set of objects is the subclasses of another object, but nothing more.

### **Structure of a Wikipedia Page**

**Types of links**

- **Article links**
  - links from one article to another of the same language;
- **Category links**
  - links from an article to special “Category” pages;
- **Interlingual links**
  - links from an article to a presumably equivalent article in another language;

**Types of special pages**

- **Redirect pages**
  - short pages which often provide equivalent names for an entity
- **Disambiguation pages**
  - a page with little content that links to multiple similarly named articles.

**Infoboxes, templates, list pages, wikipedia commons, ...**

### Combining Wikipedia Named Entities to WordNet Synsets

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.23.45 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.23.45 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### **Wikimedia Foundation**

- Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (WMF) is an American non-profit and charitable organization headquartered in San Francisco.
- It owns the internet domain names and hosts Wikipedia.
- The foundation was founded in 2003 by Jimmy Wales as a way to fund Wikipedia and its sister projects through non-profit means.
- As of 2015, the foundation employs over 280 people, with annual revenues in excess of $75 million.

**Related projects to Wikipedia:**

- **Commons** for multimedia,
- **Wiktionary** as free dictionary, and
- **Wikidata** for structured data.



### WikiData

- WikiData is an effort to convert the Wikipedia data into a knowledgebase
- WikiData aims to create a free RDF-like KB about the world that can be read/edited by humans & machines
- Wikidata clients use the repository, e.g. to populate Web pages or Wikipedia infoboxes
- WikiData increases the quality and lowers the maintenance costs of Wikipedia and related projects

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.26.33 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.26.33 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### **Wikidata Multilingual Coverage**

- The challenge: Wikipedia has many named entities that occur in numerous articles
  - E.g Ex-President Obama or President Trump are mentioned in over 100 articles
  - If one of them dies, this must be reflected on many of those pages
- Solution: Let the entry for Obama/Trump be centered in Wikidata and let all references to Obama/Trump point to the Wikidata entry

- Another aspect of Wikidata is their multilingual coverage
  - Popular entities are present in many languages (up to 180); and even in one Wikipedia page there may be many languages
  - E.g. Lucas Cranach (German Renaissance Painter) in Wikidata is referenced in 57 language tags, representing 44 languages and 13 language variants

### Wikipedia Page and WikiData Page for Douglas Adams

- Statement in Wikipedia consist of key-value pairs, which match a **property** (such as "author", or "publication date") with one or more values (such as "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle" or "1902")





### **Google Knowledge Graph**

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.29.30 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.29.30 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Introduced in 2012 with the Hummingbird update, see https://searchengineland.com/google-hummingbird-172816
- Powered in part by Freebase
- KnowledgeGraph was accused of taking away traffic from Wikipedia
- Knowledge panels are information boxes for entities (person, place, organization, event, etc)
- A common source of info is Wikipedia, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Reuters, Bloomberg

### **Knowledge Graph Enhances Google Search in 3 main ways (1):**

**1. To improve the variety of search results**,
 Google uses the knowledge graph to locate alternate interpretations of query terms,

Here it offers two of them with the same name e.g.
 **"taj mahal"** – the **mausoleum** or **musician**

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.30.08 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.30.08 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### **Knowledge Graph Enhances Google Search in 3 main ways (2):**

**2. To provide deeper and broader results, typically in an info box**
 *e.g.* person entities include relations such as age, birthplace, marital status, children, education, etc.,
 here is a sample result for Matt Groening:

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.30.43 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.30.43 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- creator of *The Simpsons*
- **Go Deeper**
  - his photo
  - when he was born
  - his spouse
  - his parents
  - why he is famous
- **Go Broader**
  - other people related to Groening

### **Knowledge Graph Enhances Google Search in 3 main ways: (3)**

**3. To provide the best summary**
 The knowledge graph exploits the relationships among the entities
 *e.g.* the query “Tesla”

The knowledge graph allows Google to summarize relevant content around that topic, including key facts you’re likely to need for that particular thing.
 *E.g.*
 **Tesla Motors, Inc. is an American automotive and energy storage company that designs, manufactures, and sells luxury electric cars, electric vehicle powertrain components, and battery products**

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.31.12 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.31.12 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />





### Google Search Combines Document Index with Knowledge Graph

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.31.54 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 10.31.54 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

- When Google recognizes in the search query that it is about an entity recorded in the KnowledgeGraph it focuses its search around the entity.
