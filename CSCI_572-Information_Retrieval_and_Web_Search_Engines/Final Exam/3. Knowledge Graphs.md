### **Outline**

- **Basic definitions:** Taxonomy, Ontology, Knowledgebase
- **Knowledgebase Internals and Examples**
- **WordNet**
- **Wikipedia**
- **Google’s Knowledge Graph**



### **What is a Taxonomy?**	

τάξις (taxis) = "arrangement"

νόμος (nomos) = "law"

- A taxonomy is a **classifÍÍication** or **categorization** of a complex system.

### What is an Ontology

- a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them, or
- a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can exist for an agent or a community of agents, or
- a body of formally represented knowledge based on a *conceptualization*: the objects, concepts, and other entities that are assumed to exist in some area of interest and the relationships that hold among them

### What is a Knowledgebase

- A **knowledgebase** (KB) is a technology used to store and retrieve complex structured and unstructured information as stored in an ontology
  - Two components:
    1. a way of *representing* information and
    2. a method for *reasoning* about the information
- A **knowledgebase** is a collection of information stored in an ontology that includes software used to author and present that information



### KnowledgeBases – Developed by AI Community

- **To move away from just using keyword matching, search engines borrowed techniques developed by AI researchers**
- A *knowledgebase* (KB) is a technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system.
- A **knowledge-based system consists of two elements**:
  1. a *knowledgebase* that *represents* facts about the world, and
  2. an *inference engine* that can *reason* about those facts (and use rules and other forms of logic to deduce new facts or highlight inconsistencies)
- **The term "knowledgebase" was coined to distinguish this form of knowledge store from the more common and widely used term \*database\***
  - Is a relational database a knowledgebase?
- *Examples of knowledgebases: Freebase, Google’s Knowledge Graph, Apple’s Siri, IBM’s Watson*



### Inferencing on KnowledgeBases

- An *inference engine* is a component of a system that applies logical rules to a knowledgebase to deduce new information
- This process is ongoing as each new fact in the knowledgebase can trigger additional rules in the inference engine
- Inference engines work primarily in one of two modes: forward chaining and backward chaining
  - **Forward chaining** starts with the known facts and asserts new facts
  - **Backward chaining** starts with goals, and works backward to determine what facts must be asserted so that the goals can be achieved
- An inference engine cycles through three sequential steps: match rules, select rules, and execute rules
- The execution of the rules will sometimes result in new facts or goals being added to the knowledgebase which will trigger the cycle to repeat. This cycle continues until no new rules can be matched
- Search engines typically use forward chaining



### Forward Chaining

- **Forward chaining** is the repeated application of modus ponens
- In propositional logic, *modus ponens* is the rule
  - “*P* implies *Q*” and “*P*” are both asserted to be true, so therefore *Q* must be true
  - Sometimes modus ponens is written as ((*P* → *Q*) and *P*) → *Q*
  - For example:
    - **If today is Tuesday, then John will go to work.**
    - **Today is Tuesday.**
    - **Therefore, John will go to work.**
- Forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data until a goal or endpoint is reached



### **Binary Relations and Instances**

Here are some sample binary relations with their type signature, e.g.
   *hasAdvisor*: Person × Person
   *graduatedAt*: Person × University
   *bornOn*: Person × Date

Here are instances of the above binary relations
   *hasAdvisor*(JimGray, MikeHarrison)
   *hasAdvisor*(Susan Davidson, Hector García-Molina)
   *graduatedAt*(JimGray, Berkeley)
   *graduatedAt*(HectorGarcia-Molina, Stanford)
   *bornOn*(JohnLennon, 9-Oct-1940)

### **Types of Knowledge For a KnowledgeBase**

- Taxonomies are narrower than ontologies since ontologies include a larger variety of relation types. Mathematically, a hierarchical **taxonomy** is a tree structure of classifications for a given set of objects. An ontology is a directed, labeled, cyclic graph.



### Search Engines Use Knowledgebases to Enhance the Display of Results

- The representation of knowledge in a knowledgebase is an object model
  - Includes classes, subclasses and instances
- A **taxonomy** is usually only a hierarchy of concepts (i.e. the *only relation* between the concepts is parent/child, or subClass/superClass, or broader/narrower)
- In a **knowledgebase**, *arbitrary complex relations* between concepts can be expressed as well, e.g. (X *marriedTo* Y; or A *worksFor* B; or C *locatedIn* D, etc.)
- Search engines utilize this linked, structured data in many ways, such as
  - Providing direct answers to queries
  - Enhanced displays in many varieties of engaging visual formats, e.g. see query “Picasso” in Google



### **Is Elvis Alive**

(Screenshots from search engines are displayed: Ask.com, Bing.com, Google.com, Wolfram Alpha)

- **Ask.com – Mostly Yes**
- **Bing.com – Yes/Maybe**
- **Google.com – No**
- **Wolfram Alpha – No**

**Conclusion:**
 **2 Yes’es and 2 No’s;
 text matching alone is insufficient
 we need to “understand” the query**



### Close Up: A KnowledgeBase for Elvis

### **Inheritance**

- An important feature of knowledge representation is its organization into *class hierarchies*. Classes can be based on the properties of objects/concepts.
- Inheritance is a relation by which
   – 1. an individual assumes the properties of its class and
   – 2. determines which properties of a class are passed on to its subclass.
- In order to support inheritance, objects/concepts must be organized into classes and classes must be arranged in a generalized hierarchy
   – the most generic object/concept is at the top of the hierarchy and the most specific is at the bottom of the hierarchy.

### **Some Advantages of Inheritance**

- Inheritance provides a natural mechanism for *representing taxonomically structured knowledge*
- Inheritance provides an economical means of *expressing properties common to a class of objects/concepts*
- Inheritance *guarantees that all members of a class inherit the appropriate properties*, thus ensuring consistency with the class definition
- Inheritance *reduces the size of the knowledge base* as properties are defined once for the most general type of objects/concepts and these properties are then shared by other less generic objects/concepts in the type hierarchy.



### **Different Notations for a KnowledgeBase**

- Resource Description Format (RDF) is a W3C spec used for creating ontologies:
  - https://www.w3.org/RDF/
  - Sometimes "RDF Ontology" and "KnowledgeBase (KB)" are used synonymously.

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.03.35 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.03.35 PM" style="zoom:40%;" />

### **RDF Data Model**

- RDF allows us to make statements about resources.
   The format of these statements is:
   `<subject> <predicate> <object>`
- Some examples:
   `<Bob> <is a> <person>`
   `<Bob> <is a friend of> <Alice>`
   `<Bob> <is born on> <the 4th of July 1990>`
   `<Bob> <is interested in> <the Mona Lisa>`
   `<the Mona Lisa> <was created by> <Leonardo da Vinci>`
   `<the video 'La Joconde à Washington'> <is about> <the Mona Lisa>`
- We can visualize triples as a connected **graph**.
   Graphs consist of nodes and arcs.
   The subjects and objects of the triples make up the nodes in the graph;
   the predicates form the arcs.
- One query language for making inferences on these graphs is **SPARQL**.

### To Answer a Question Knowledgebases Need to Combine Information From *Multiple Sources*

- Extractors take the information from various sources and re-work it into a form consistent with the knowledgebase.

### **KnowledgeBases Can Be Represented as Labeled MultiGraphs**

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.07.35 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.07.35 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

A knowledgebase can be seen as a directed labeled multigraph, where the nodes are entities and the edges relations.

A multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges that have the same end nodes. Two vertices may be connected by more than one edge



### A Single Entity Can Have Different Labels

### To Build a Knowledgebase One Must Find Classes and Instances

### We Need to Match Entities, Classes and Relations

<img src="3. Knowledge Graphs.assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.10.05 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 7.10.05 PM" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Combining Elements From Different Knowledgebases Meaning Matching Entities

Build a graph:

- nodes: pairs of entities, weighted with similarity
- edges: weighted with degree of relatedness

Iterate until convergence: similarity := weighted sum of neighbor similarities

many variants (belief propagation, label propagation, etc.)

### Semantic Network

- **A semantic network is a knowledge representation scheme that represents knowledge as a graph.**
  - The nodes of the graph correspond to concepts or facts and
  - the arc correspond to relations or associations between concepts.
  - In a semantic network both the nodes and arcs are labeled

### Semantic Network

- A semantic network that defines the properties of snow and ice
- The concept snowman inherits all the properties of snow
- The concept of ice and snow share a number of properties

### Expressing Relationship in Semantic Networks

- The most important link in a semantic network is the is-a link
- A semantic network can organize knowledge in a hierarchy by using the is-a link such that the lower nodes inherit the properties of the higher nodes

### WordNet is a Lexical DataBase with many Classes, Subclasses, and Superclasses

- **WordNet**, developed at Princeton, is a lexical database for the English language.
  - It groups English words into sets of synonyms called **synsets**,
    - provides short definitions and usage examples,
    - records a number of relations among these synonym sets or their members.
