##### Web Search Engine Elements

- Spider (a.k.a. crawler/robot) – builds corpus
  - Collects web pages recursively
    - For each known URL, fetch the page, parse it, and extract new URLs
    - Repeat
  - Additional pages come from direct submissions & other sources
- The indexer – creates inverted indexes
  - Various policies wrt which words are indexed, capitalization, support for Unicode, stemming, support for phrases, etc.
- Query processor – serves query results
  - Front end – query reformulation, word stemming, capitalization,
    optimization of Booleans, etc.
  - Back end – finds matching documents and ranks them

##### The Web

- Distributed content creation, linking 
- Content includes truth, lies, obsolete information, contradictions … 
- Data is stored in structured (databases), semi-structured (tables)… 
- Scale larger than previous text corpora 
- Growth – still expanding 
- Content can be dynamically generated

##### Query Processing is Now Extremely Clever

- Query processing involves much more than just matching query terms with document terms 
- **Semantic analysis of the query includes:** 
  1. Determining the language of the query 
  2. Filtering of unnecessary words from the query (stop words) 
  3. Looking for specific types of queries, e.g. • Personalities (triggered on names) • Cities (travel info, maps) • Medical info (triggered on names and/or results) • Stock quotes, news (triggered on stock symbol) • Company info … 
  4. Determining the user’s location or the target location of the query 
  5. Remembering previous queries 
  6. Maintaining a user profile
